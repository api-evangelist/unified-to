  Unified is a real-time unified API platform that provides access to over 360
  integrations across 22 categories for B2B SaaS and AI-native products. Unlike
  traditional integration platforms that cache or sync data periodically,
  Unified operates with a pass-through architecture where every request hits the
  source API live, ensuring no stale data and eliminating the need for storage
  of customer information. The platform offers deeply normalized unified
  objects, endpoints, and errors across all integrations while supporting custom
  fields and objects, and includes AI-ready features like real-time data streams
  for RAG/embeddings and MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools that grant LLMs
  controlled access to integrations. Unified focuses on zero-storage by design
  for compliance and security, with regionalized traffic routing, and offers
  transparent usage-based pricing that scales with API volume rather than
  customer count, allowing companies to deploy production integrations in days
  across categories like CRM, ATS, accounting, e-commerce, and messaging.
